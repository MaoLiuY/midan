I started playing drums at school around age 11. I progressed from tapping out rhythms on a snare drum to help prepare for piano grade exams to spending all my breaks in a music practice room teaching myself how to play school's 4 piece Premier Olympic kit (and that will give some of you an idea of how long ago that was).

I joined all the school music groups playing percussion - from triangle to timpani - in the orchestra, and drum kit in the brass band and dance band. I loved the dance band which played the big band classics at all sorts of functions both in and outside school.

But as a result of the school dance band I also enjoyed jazz. I was fortunate enough to attend a clinic by [Jon Hiseman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hiseman) of Colosseum and Paraphernalia but my absolute drumming highlight has to be going to see [Buddy Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Rich) in concert when he played at Chichester Festival Theatre on 25th October 1984 as part of his European tour. I still have the programme.

Since then I have continued to play drums in various bands playing firstly original material and now covers. I am largely self taught. I've had some lessons at different times but never found a teacher that I connected with enough to feel I was getting value for money.

After university I started work and found myself unable to practice regularly. In those days there were no affordable electronic kits even practice pads were hard to find. So my progress slowed and I often got frustrated with my playing.

Some years later, I am now fortunate enough to have my own practice and recording studio at the bottom of the garden, where my Sakae Trilogy kit has a permanent home alongside my recording gear. My practice time is informed by [Drumeo](https://www.drumeo.com), [Stephen's Drum Shed](https://www.stephensdrumshed.com) (Stephen Taylor) and [Four Hands Drumming](http://fourhandsdrumming.com) (Carter McLean). I'm back to regular practice and finding my playing is improving again and yes, it feels good!
